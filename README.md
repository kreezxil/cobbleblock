# cobbleblock
an alternative to stoneblock with better mods.

# synopsis
After 1000's of  years underground you awaken to find that apocalyptic land from whence you slumbered has long since gone and stabilized. You regain your conscience and come to realize that you are in a living geode. Or rather you are the life inside the geode. Like the ancient creator you must create the basics of construction from the rock around you to produce ever more advanced tech.

Will you survive or go bat shit insane?

Patterned off of Stoneblock I & II and built with mods that in my opinion actually work. Instead of AE2 you get Refined Storage.
